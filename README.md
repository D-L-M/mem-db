# MemDB

![](https://travis-ci.org/D-L-M/mem-db.svg?branch=master)

MemDB is an attempt to create a very simple in-memory database using inverted indices.

It is primarily an experiment to learn how to code in Go, so should neither be relied upon in production nor treated too harshly when looking at the code!

## Setting Up

Start the server by running:

```bash
go run ./src/main.go
```

MemDB will listen for TCP connections on port 9999.

## Storing Documents

To store a document, make a HTTP `PUT` request with the JSON document as the request body to `http://localhost:9999/{id}`, where `{id}` is the unique identifier of the document to store.

Alternatively you can omit the ID to have one randomly generated for the document.

## Retrieving Documents

To retrieve a document, make a HTTP `GET` request to `http://localhost:9999/{id}`, where `{id}` is the unique identifier of the document to retrieve.

## Searching

To search for documents, make a HTTP `GET` or `POST` request to `http://localhost:9999/_search` with a JSON body describing the search criteria, for example:

```javascript
{
  "and":
    [
      {"equals": {"fieldName": 123}}
    ]
}
```

The top-most node of the JSON request must always be represented by an `and` or `or` key that contains an array of criteria that must either all be satisfied (`and`) or at least one of which must be satisfied (`or`).

The top-most node of each criterion object can be one of the following: `equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`, `not_contains` â€” the 'contains' options allow searching of individual words within string fields.

Field names should be given in dot-notation, with numeric array indices removed. For example:

```javascript
{
  "field1": "value", // field1
  "field2":
    {
      "field3": "value" // field2.field3
    },
  "field4":
    [
      {
        "field5": "value" // field4.field5
      },
      {
        "field6": "value" // field4.field6
      }
    ]
}
```

To buid up complex criteria, a further `and` or `or` criteria set can be nested. For example:

```javascript
{
  "and":
    [
      {"equals": {"age": 30}},
      {
        "or":
          [
            {"equals": {"address.country": "Wales"}},
            {"contains": {"full_name": "Smith"}}
          ]
      }
    ]
}
```

In this example, documents would match where the field `age` was equal to 30 and either the `address.country` field was equal to 'Wales' or the `full_name` field contained the word 'Smith' (note that string searches are case-insensitive).

If required, criteria can be nested many levels deep.

## Viewing Index Statistics

To view index statistics, make a HTTP `GET` request to `http://localhost:9999/_stats`.

## Testing

To run the project's unit tests, simply run:

```bash
npm test
```
